## üß© Chip Floorplanning Considerations  

### üîπ Utilization Factor and Aspect Ratio  
- **Utilization Factor (UF)** = (Area occupied by cells / Total core area).  
  - High UF ‚áí Compact design but can cause routing congestion.  
  - Low UF ‚áí More routing space but larger chip size.  
- **Aspect Ratio (AR)** = Height / Width of the core.  
  - AR = 1 gives a square core, preferred for balanced routing.

### üîπ Concept of Pre-Placed Cells  
Pre-placed cells are large functional blocks such as memories, PLLs, or analog IPs placed early in the floorplan to define core structure and connectivity.  
They are fixed during placement to ensure stable timing paths and predictable layout quality.

### üîπ Decoupling Capacitors  
Decoupling capacitors (**Decaps**) are placed near logic clusters to minimize voltage fluctuations due to instantaneous current demands.  
They help maintain stable **VDD** levels during high-speed switching and reduce IR drop noise.

### üîπ Power Planning  
Power Planning involves creating **VDD/VSS power grids** across the chip to deliver stable supply voltage.  
Upper metal layers are used for **power straps** because of their lower resistance and higher current-carrying capacity.  

![Power Planning Grid](Screenshots/power_planning_grid1.png)  

#### problem in the above VDD supply: 
Due to single voltage source, it may get weaken due to the resistance,inductance in the circuit. So this leads to inadequate availablity of supply in the input of the cells  

![Power Planning Grid](Screenshots/power_planning_grid2.png)  

#### SOlution for the above problem:
Providing Mutliple Vdd and Vss tap points reduces the chance of getting above problem

![Power Planning Grid](Screenshots/power_planning_grid3.png)  
The above Screenshots explain how vdd and vss line will be facbricated in the chip. The above problem is the reason why all modern processors have multiple Vdd and Vss ports.

### üîπ Pin Placement and Logical Cell Placement Blockage  
- **Pin Placement:** Properly positioned I/O pins minimize routing congestion and timing delay.  
- **Placement Blockages:** Used to reserve areas where no standard cells should be placed ‚Äî helpful near macros or high-activity regions.

### üîπ Steps to Run Floorplan using OpenLANE  
1. Navigate to the OpenLANE design directory.  
2. Run the floorplan command:  

   ```bash
    # Change directory to openlane flow directory
    cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

    # alias docker='docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) efabless/openlane:v0.21'
    # Since we have aliased the long command to 'docker' we can invoke the OpenLANE flow docker sub-system by just running this command
    docker
    # Now that we have entered the OpenLANE flow contained docker sub-system we can invoke the OpenLANE flow in the Interactive mode using the following command
    ./flow.tcl -interactive

    # Now that OpenLANE flow is open we have to input the required packages for proper functionality of the OpenLANE flow
    package require openlane 0.9

    # Now the OpenLANE flow is ready to run any design and initially we have to prep the design creating some necessary files and directories for running a specific design which in our case is 'picorv32a'
    prep -design picorv32a

    # Now that the design is prepped and ready, we can run synthesis using following command
    run_synthesis

    # Now we can run floorplan
    run_floorplan
    ```
    
3. Check log files in runs/<design_name>/logs/floorplan/.
4. Generated DEF and LEF files define placement boundaries and I/O regions.

### üîπ Review Floorplan Layout in Magic

Open the generated layout in Magic VLSI to visualize standard cell regions, pin positions, and power grid routing.
    ```bash
    # Change directory to path containing generated floorplan def
    cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/17-03_12-06/results/floorplan/

    # Command to load the floorplan def in magic tool
    magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.floorplan.def &
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Library Binding and Placement

### üîπ Netlist Binding and Initial Place Design

After synthesis, the netlist (gate-level design) is mapped to available standard cells from the library.
OpenLANE performs initial placement using this binding information to ensure cell connectivity consistency.

![Placement](Screenshots/Placement1.png) 

### üîπ Optimize Placement using Estimated Wire-Length and Capacitance

Placement optimization minimizes wire-length and capacitive load between connected cells.
Estimated interconnect lengths help the tool improve timing and reduce power.
Repeater(Buffers) are used to ensure the signal intergrity. Repeaters are placed where the cell is far away from the required pin.

![Placement](Screenshots/Placement2.png) 

### üîπ Final Placement Optimization

Final placement fine-tunes cell positions to eliminate overlaps, ensure proper alignment, and meet timing closure constraints.

![Placement](Screenshots/Placement3.png) 

### üîπ Need for Libraries and Characterization

Libraries contain timing, power, and physical data for each standard cell.
Characterization ensures that every cell behaves as expected across process, voltage, and temperature corners (PVT).

### üîπ Congestion-Aware Placement using RePlAce

RePlAce is OpenLANE‚Äôs global placement engine. It performs congestion-aware placement by balancing density and connectivity, preventing routing bottlenecks and improving timing.

Run 'picorv32a' design congestion aware placement using OpenLANE flow and generate necessary outputs.
Command to run placement:
    ```bash
        # Congestion aware placement by default
        run_placement
    ```

## üß† Cell Design and Characterization Flows

### üîπ Inputs for Cell Design Flow

##### Inputs include:
- Specification sheet
- Process Design Kit (PDK)
- SPICE models
- Design constraints

![Cell Design](Screenshots/celldesign1.png)
![Cell Design](Screenshots/celldesign2.png)
### üîπ Circuit Design Step

At this stage, transistor-level schematics are designed using tools like Xschem or Ngspice to verify logical and electrical behavior.

![Cell Design](Screenshots/celldesign3.png)

### üîπ Layout Design Step

The schematic is translated into a physical layout using Magic VLSI, following design rules and layer definitions from the PDK.
The layout is then verified using DRC and LVS checks.

### üîπ Typical Characterization Flow

Each cell undergoes:
- SPICE simulation for timing extraction.
- Delay measurement across multiple load/slew conditions.
- Generation of .lib timing models for synthesis and STA tools.

## ‚è±Ô∏è General Timing Characterization Parameters

### üîπ Timing Threshold Definitions

Timing analysis uses threshold voltage points to define signal transitions.
- Input threshold ‚âà 50% of VDD
- Output threshold ‚âà 50% of VDD
These points determine where propagation delay is measured.

![Timing Char](Screenshots/risefall1.png)
![Timing Char](Screenshots/risefall2.png)

### üîπ Propagation Delay and Transition Time
Propagation Delay (tp): Time for the output to respond to an input change (measured from 50% Vin ‚Üí 50% Vout).
Transition Time (Tr/Tf): Time taken for a signal to rise (10% ‚Üí 90%) or fall (90% ‚Üí 10%).
These parameters are critical in library characterization for accurate timing closure.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Talk to a Computer  

### üîπ Introduction to QFN-48 Package, Chip, Pads, Core, Die, and IPs  
In any embedded board, what we usually call a ‚Äúchip‚Äù is actually the **package** ‚Äî a protective layer over the actual silicon die. The **chip** lies at the center of the package, connected to it through **wire bonding**.  

![Package Example](Screenshots/package.png)  

Inside the chip:  
- **Pads** handle all external connections.  
- The **Core** contains the logic circuits.  
- Both pads and core together form the **Die**, the basic manufacturing unit of a chip.  

![Chip Structure](Screenshots/chip_structure.png)  

**Foundries** manufacture chips. Their specialized design blocks are called **Foundry IPs**, while reusable logic blocks are known as **Macros**.

### üîπ Introduction to RISC-V  

A **C program** must follow a flow before reaching hardware execution.  
It first compiles into **RISC-V assembly instructions (ISA)**, which are then converted into **binary machine language (0s and 1s)** understood by hardware.  

The **RISC-V ISA (Reduced Instruction Set Computing ‚Äì V)** defines how the software communicates with the hardware.  

![RISC-V ISA Flow](Screenshots/riscv_isa_flow.png)  

Finally, the **RTL** (Hardware Description Language) implements these instructions, and through the **PnR (Place and Route)** process, we reach the **final GDSII layout** ready for fabrication.  

---

### üîπ From Software to Hardware  

When an application (like a stopwatch app) runs on hardware, several layers are involved:  

1. **Application Software** ‚Üí C/C++/Java code  
2. **System Software** ‚Üí Converts to binary  
   - Includes **OS**, **Compiler**, and **Assembler**  
3. **Hardware** ‚Üí Executes the binary code  

![Software to Hardware Layers](Screenshots/software_to_hardware_layers.png)  

Example flow for a stopwatch app on a RISC-V core:  

- Compiler output ‚Üí RISC-V instructions  
- Assembler output ‚Üí Binary machine code  
- RTL implements these instructions  
- RTL synthesized ‚Üí Gate-level netlist  
- Fabricated into the chip  

![Stopwatch Flow Example](Screenshots/stopwatch_flow.png)  

This course covers three main parts:  
1. **RISC-V ISA**  
2. **RTL and Synthesis of RISC-V-based CPU Core (PicoRV32)**  
3. **Physical Design Implementation of PicoRV32**

## ‚öôÔ∏è SoC Design and OpenLANE  

### üîπ Introduction to All Components of Open-Source Digital ASIC Design  

For open-source ASIC design, three major enablers are required:  
1. **RTL Designs**  
2. **EDA Tools**  
3. **PDK Data (Process Design Kit)**  

![ASIC Design](Screenshots/ASIC_design.png)  

Initially, chip design and fabrication were tightly coupled. In 1979, **Lynn Conway** and **Carver Mead** revolutionized this by separating **design** and **fabrication**, introducing structured design rules and the concept of **fabless companies**.  

![VLSI History](Screenshots/vlsi_history.png)  

The interface between design and fabrication became the **Process Design Kit (PDK)** ‚Äî containing device models, libraries, and design rules.  

Google‚Äôs collaboration with **SkyWater** led to the release of the first **open-source PDK (Sky130)** in June 2020.

### üîπ Simplified RTL2GDS Flow  

The **ASIC Design Flow** takes a design from **RTL ‚Üí GDSII** (fabrication layout format).  

![ASIC Flow](Screenshots/asic_flow.png)  

**Synthesis** converts RTL code into gate-level circuits using **Standard Cell Libraries (SCLs)**, producing a **netlist**.  

![Synthesis Flow](Screenshots/synthesis_flow.png)  

Each standard cell has multiple views:  
- **Liberty View (.lib)** ‚Äì Timing & power data  
- **Behavioral Model (HDL)** ‚Äì Functional model  
- **SPICE/CDL View** ‚Äì Transistor-level netlist  
- **Layout View (GDSII, LEF)** ‚Äì Physical layout

### üîπ Introduction to OpenLANE and Strive Chipsets  

**OpenLANE** is an open-source ASIC design automation flow developed for **Sky130 PDK**. It integrates multiple EDA tools to perform synthesis, floorplanning, placement, CTS, routing, and sign-off.  

![OpenLANE Overview](Screenshots/openlane_overview.png)  

The **Strive** family of open-source chipsets are built using this exact flow, demonstrating the real-world success of open-source silicon.

### üîπ Introduction to OpenLANE Detailed ASIC Design Flow  

1. **Chip Floorplanning** ‚Äì Define chip dimensions and pad locations  
   ![Chip Floorplan](Screenshots/chip_floorplan.png)  
2. **Macro Floorplanning** ‚Äì Place large IP blocks  
   ![Macro Floorplan](Screenshots/macro_floorplan.png)  
3. **Power Planning** ‚Äì Distribute power efficiently to avoid IR drop and electromigration  
   ![Power Planning](Screenshots/power_planning.png)  
4. **Placement** ‚Äì Global and detailed cell placements  
   ![Placement](Screenshots/placement.png)  
5. **Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)** ‚Äì Ensure clock signal reaches all components with minimal skew  
   ![Clock Tree Synthesis](Screenshots/cts.png)  
6. **Routing** ‚Äì Connect all cells; SkyWater PDK uses 6 routing layers  
   ![Routing](Screenshots/routing.png)  

After routing, sign-off checks ensure correctness:  
- **DRC** (Design Rule Check)  
- **LVS** (Layout vs Schematic)  
- **STA** (Static Timing Analysis)

## üß© Get Familiar with Open-Source EDA Tools  

### üîπ OpenLANE Directory Structure in Detail  
Explore folders like `designs/`, `pdks/`, and `flow/` to understand configuration and result storage.  

![OpenLANE Directory1](Screenshots/openlane_directory.png)  

### üîπ Design Preparation Step  
The design prep step sets up all required files for synthesis and physical design.  
![OpenLANE Directory2](Screenshots/openlane2.jpeg)  

### üîπ Review Files After Design Prep and Run Synthesis  
After preparation, you can verify generated netlists, logs, and synthesis reports.  

#### Synthesis


Day1 tasks:- 
1. Run 'picorv32a' design synthesis using OpenLANE flow and generate necessary outputs.
2. Calculate the flop ratio.

```math
Flop\ Ratio = \frac{Number\ of\ D\ Flip\ Flops}{Total\ Number\ of\ Cells}
```
```math
Percentage\ of\ DFF's = Flop\ Ratio * 100
```

* All day 1 logs, reports and results can be found in following run folder:
'''

'''

#### 1. Run 'picorv32a' design synthesis using OpenLANE flow and generate necessary outputs.

Commands to invoke the OpenLANE flow and perform synthesis

```bash
# Change directory to openlane flow directory
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

# alias docker='docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) efabless/openlane:v0.21'
# Since we have aliased the long command to 'docker' we can invoke the OpenLANE flow docker sub-system by just running this command
docker
```
```tcl
# Now that we have entered the OpenLANE flow contained docker sub-system we can invoke the OpenLANE flow in the Interactive mode using the following command
./flow.tcl -interactive

# Now that OpenLANE flow is open we have to input the required packages for proper functionality of the OpenLANE flow
package require openlane 0.9

# Now the OpenLANE flow is ready to run any design and initially we have to prep the design creating some necessary files and directories for running a specific design which in our case is 'picorv32a'
prep -design picorv32a

# Now that the design is prepped and ready, we can run synthesis using following command
run_synthesis

# Exit from OpenLANE flow
exit

# Exit from OpenLANE flow docker sub-system
exit
```

![SynReport2](Screenshots/SynReport2.jpeg)  

Calculation of Flop Ratio and DFF % from synthesis statistics report file

```math
Flop\ Ratio = \frac{1613}{14876} = 0.108429685
```
```math
Percentage\ of\ DFF's = 0.108429685 * 100 = 10.84296854\ \%
```


### üîπ OpenLANE Project Git Link Description
